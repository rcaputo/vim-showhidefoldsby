ShowHideFoldsBy 0.0.0 (unreleased)

This is a library of functions that can show and hide folds by various
criteria.

It is currently very incomplete, as it's been written to scratch a
particular itch that has currently stopped itching.  If someone has a
similar itch, I invite them to submit a pull request with their
scratch.  See |showhidefoldsby-contributing| for details.

Installing~

This library contains two subdirectories: doc, and autoload.  Place them into
your vim 'runtimepath'.  Pathogen, Vundle, etc. may make this easier to
manage.

Usage~

This library provides a way to switch a buffer's view between different
contexts based on foldable highlight groups.

The original purpose was to mitigate the disruption of flow in program sources
that interleave documentation and code.

For example, in a Perl buffer, this command will open all Perl subroutine
folds and hide all the rest:

  :call showfoldsby#HighlightGroup('perlSubFold')

This opens all Perl documentation folds and hides all the rest:

  :call showfoldsby#HighlightGroup('perlPOD')

These can be mapped to keystrokes:

  " Focus on the documentation.
  autoload FileType perl
    \ nnoremap <silent> z1
    \ :call showfoldsby#HighlightGroup('perlPOD')<CR>

  " Focus on the code.
  autoload FileType perl
    \ nnoremap <silent> z2
    \ :call showfoldsby#HighlightGroup('perlSubFold')<CR>

                                                     *showhidefoldsby-functions*
Public Functions~

Public functions are implemented in showfoldsby.vim and hidefoldsby.vim.

                                                                *HighlightGroup*
showfoldsby#HighlightGroup~

Open all folds tagged with the specified highlight group.  All folds that do
not have the highlight group will be folded.

  :call showfoldsby#HighlightGroup('perlSubFold')

There currently is no hidefoldsby#HighlightGroup(), but the library naming
scheme has been designed to support its addition if/when someone needs it.

Private Functions~

Private functions are implemented in showhidefoldsby.vim.  They're documented
here for convenience.

                                                                     *SaveState*
SaveState~

Save the state of the window and buffer, and clear the visual and audible
bells.  The state can be restored with |RestoreState|.

Functions showing and hiding folds over an entire buffer have a tendency to
ring the terminal bell at EOF.  Temporarily clearing and restoring the visual
and audible bell states works around this problem.

Calling SaveState() twice in succession will cause the previous saved state to
be lost.  Re-entrancy isn't currently needed, otherwise this limitation would
be an issue.

                                                                  *RestoreState*
RestoreState~

Restore state that was previously saved with SaveState().  Puts the cursor
back to its previously saved place in the window and buffer.  Restores the
terminal visual and audible bell states.  Unlets the saved-state variables.
